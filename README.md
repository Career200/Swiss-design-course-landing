# Swiss-design-course-landing

Something I designed in Figma while listening to a course on swiss design and made into a website real quick.

It looks better as a design file ;(

Here's a deploy: https://career404.github.io/Swiss-design-course-landing/
...and here's a link to design file https://www.figma.com/proto/9lDkHV2G5pxPoaBy6AWVce/Switzerland-2020?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1%3A2&viewport=99%2C-1400%2C0.68&scaling=min-zoom
